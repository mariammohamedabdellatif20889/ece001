     <h2>definition</h2>
     <p> it holds and allows communication between many of electronic components of a system such as central 
         processing unit and memory and provides connectors for other peripherals.<br><br>
         A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer,
          like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card.<br> There are multiple types
           of motherboards, designed to fit different types and sizes of computers.<br><br>
           Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory,
           so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However, hard drives are mostly
           universal and work with the majority of motherboards, regardless of the type or brand.<br>
