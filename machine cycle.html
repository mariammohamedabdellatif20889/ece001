        <h2>definition</h2>
        <p>A machine cycle consists of the steps that a computerâ€™s processor executes whenever it receives
             a machine language instruction. It is the most basic CPU operation, and modern CPUs are able
             to perform millions of machine cycles per second. The cycle consists of three standard steps:
              fetch, decode and execute. In some cases, store is also incorporated into the cycle.</p>
