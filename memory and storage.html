     <h1 style="color:CA3110;">memoryand storage</h1>
      <p>Computer memory, device that is used to store data or programs (sequences of instructions) 
      on a temporary or permanent basis for use in an electronic digital computer. Computers represent
      information in binary code, written as sequences of 0s and 1s.<br> Each binary digit (or “bit”) may
      be stored by any physical system that can be in either of two stable states, to represent 0 and 1.<br>
      Such a system is called bistable. This could be an on-off switch, an electrical capacitor that
       can store or lose a charge, a magnet with its polarity up or down, or a surface that can have
           a pit or not. <br>Today capacitors and transistors, functioning as tiny electrical switches, are 
           used for temporary storage, and either disks or tape with a magnetic coating, or plastic discs
            with patterns of pits are used for long-term storage.<p>
        <h2>types of memory</h2>
        <p>Although many types of memory in a computer exist, the most basic distinction is between primary
         memory, often called system memory, and secondary memory, which is more commonly called storage.
      The key difference between primary and secondary memory is speed of access.<br>
      <b>Primary memory</b>  includes ROM and RAM, and is located close to the CPU on the computer motherboard,
          enabling the CPU to read data from primary memory very quickly indeed. It is used to store data
           that the CPU needs imminently so that it does not have to wait for it to be delivered.<br>
         <b> Secondary memory</b>  is usually physically located within a separate storage device,
          such as a hard disk drive or solid state drive (SSD), which is connected to the computer system
            either directly or over a network. The cost per gigabyte of secondary memory is much lower,
            but the read and write speeds are significantly slower.</p>

           <h2>storage</h2>
           <p>Alternatively referred to as digital storage, storage, storage media, or storage medium,
              a storage device is any hardware capable of holding information either temporarily or 
             permanently. The picture shows an example of a Drobo, an external secondary mass storage device.
            There are two types of storage devices used with computers:<br> <b>primary storage device</b> 
            such as RAM, and a secondary storage device, such as a hard drive. <br>
           <b> Secondary storage </b>can be removable, internal, or external.</p>
           <h2>types of storage</h2>
           <p><b>sequential:</b>hardware that reads and writes data in a serial fashion<br>
           <b>random access:</b>hardware that reads and writes data without going through a sequence
            of locations<br>
          <b>magnetic:</b>hardware that uses disks that coated with magnetic material<br>
               <b>optical:</b>hardware that uses laser beams to read data from plastic disk</p>
